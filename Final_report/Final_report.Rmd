## Background 

Native speakers (NSs) and non-native speakers (NNSs) have been found to experience garden-path effects when reading a temporarily structurally ambiguous sentence (Dussias & Scaltz,2008; Garnsey et al., 1997). The extent to which NNSs differ from NSs in their use of various types of linguistic information for structural reanalysis remains a topic of debate (Hopp, 2015; Jegerski, 2012). Verb bias as a type of fine-grained lexical information has been demonstrated to influence reanalysis difficulty in both NSs and NNSs (Juffs, 2004; Van Gompel et al., 2001). When reading a sentence with a DO (direct object) - biased verb and a sentence with SC (sentential complement) biased verb, as in (1a) and (1b), both NSs and NNSs were slow to read the disambiguating regions compared to similar regions in the unambiguous control sentences (Juffs, 2004; Qian et al., 2019). This suggests that NSs and NNSs are sensitive to verb bias information for ambiguity resolution.

Verb bias which has been widely investigated in previous studies essentially is a non-structural factor. The current investigation, however, addresses the influence from a verb pertaining to its structural properties on L2 ambiguity resolution. According to the structural change theory (Pritchett, 1992), reanalysis is particularly challenging when it involves a major rearrangement of thematic structure. For example, sentences like (1) involve NP/S ambiguities since they can take either a NP or a sentence (S) as the complement; sentences like (2) involve NP/Z ambiguities since they can take either a NP as the complement or no (Zero) complement. This theory predicts that NP/Z reanalysis should be more difficult than NP/S reanalysis because NP/Z reanalysis relative to NP/S reanalysis requires the NP following the verb to be moved out of its thematic domain. Sturt et al. (1999) experimentally confirmed this prediction among NSs. This study aims to examine whether NNSs are sensitive to this structural property, thus directly testing this theory in NNSs.Specifically, three research questions are raised as follows.

(1). Is processing difficulty at disambiguation greater in NP/Z ambiguity than in NP/S ambiguity for L1 and L2 learners? <br/>
(2). Do L1 and L2 learners equally show sensitivity to verb-related structural properties during L2 sentence processing? <br/>
(3). Does proficiency modulate learners’ sensitivity to verb properties?

## Method 

24 English native speakers and 65 Chinese learners of English read English sentences segment by segment in a self-paced reading (SPR) task with a 2 (Complement type: NP/S vs. NP/Z) * 2 (Ambiguity: ambiguous vs. unambiguous) factorial design. Experimental sentences are adapted from Sturt et al. (1999). (2a) & (2b) are for the *ambiguous* condition. For the *unambiguous* condition, sentences like (2c) are created from (2a) by adding a complementizer *that* following the verb, and sentences like (2d) from (2b) by adding a comma following the verb. Sentences were checked for their plausibility with an acceptability judgement by a subset of participants who participated in the SPR task. To ensure that the verbs are biased toward the NP reading, I also checked the statistical distribution of the kind of complement the verbs prefer in the COCA corpus. 

2. (a). The Australian woman / saw the famous doctor / had been drinking / quite a lot.<br/>
   (b). Before the woman / visited the famous doctor / had been drinking / quite a lot.<br/>
   (c). The Australian woman saw that the famous doctor had been drinking quite a lot.<br/>
   (d). Before the woman visited, the famous doctor had been drinking quite a lot.<br/>

## Results and Discussion

In this section, I reported on the results for each experimental task. First, as for the COCA, a subset of text data was extracted and POS tagged. The tagged data were submitted for further processing by which any verb in its past tense following either that or a noun phrase+ a verb was labeled as S-biased and otherwise NP-biased. I acknowledged that instances such as 'The professor accepted that theory may be falsely counted as S-biased but in fact they should be NP-biased. COCA data were visualized in Figure 1, which indicates that these verbs are strongly NP-biased.

Roughly going through the data set, I found that such instances were in small number. Future investigation with a large sample of data will go with dependency parsing for determining the type of complement bias. As for the acceptability judgement task (AJT), ratings were z-score transformed by group and condition to mitigate scale bias. AJT was visualized in Figure 2. Linear mixed-effects models were fit for the z-score transformed ratings. The random-effect structure was kept maximal by adding the by-subject and by-item intercept and the by-subject random slope for Complement Type and by-item slope for Group. The fixed effect for Complement Type was sum coded. The random effect structure was simplified only when models converged. The result showed that ratings did not significantly differ by condition (*β*=-0.05, *SE*=0.09, *p*=.554) and language group (*β*=-0.04, *SE*=0.06, *p*=.543), thus ruling out plausibility as a potential confound.

For the self-paced reading task,the data were trimmed as follows prior to statistical analyses. First, participants whose accuracy on the comprehension question lower than 80 % were excluded. Reaction times (RTs) beyond 2.5 SDs from the mean were removed. RTs were then log transformed to approach normal distribution. The log-transformed RTs were residualized to adjust for the variability in word length and individual reading speed. Data across regions from L1 and L2 speakers were plotted in Figure 3 and 4 respectively. Only region 3, *critical region*, was analyzed with linear mixed-effects models. For the native speakers, the random effect structure was also kept maximal by adding the by-item and by-subject intercept, and by-subject random slope for Ambiguity and Complement type.Fixed effects for complement type and ambiguity were sum coded. For L2 speakers, the random effect structure was identical as above except that the by-item random slope for Language Proficiency was additionally added. For the L1, there are main effects of Ambiguity and Complement Type such that unambiguous sentences were read faster their ambiguous counterparts (*β*=0.224, *SE*=0.039, *p*<.0001),and NP/S sentences were read more quickly than NP/Z sentences (*β*=-0.124, *SE*=0.039, *p*=.0016). Critically, there was an interaction between Complement Type and Ambiguity such that NP/S sentences were read faster than NP/Z sentences only in the ambiguous condition (*β*=-0.194, *SE*=0.055, *p*=.0005).For the L2, main effects of Ambiguity and Complemet Type were also present. Similarly, Ambiguity and Complemet Type interacte such that NP/S sentences were read faster than NP/Z sentences only in the ambiguous condition (*β*=-0.117, *SE*=0.042, *p*=.0054).Proficiency modulated only the overall RTs but not the extent to which learners were sensitive to structural properties (*β*=0.044, *SE*=0.018, *p*=.0137). As such, both the L1 and L2 speakers were sensitive to the structural properties pertaining to verbs, and proficiency did not modulate learners' sensitivity.

## Reflection

Overall, it's not an easy task for me to wrap up all these analysis procedures, especially for the COCA one which involves the flexible use of regular expressions. As said, it would be necessary to practice dependency parsing on the COCA data in the future work. But aspects of the analysis processes are really rewarding, i.e., data wrangling, statistical modeling, R Markdown.
